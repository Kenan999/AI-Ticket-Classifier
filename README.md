# AI Ticket Classifier — Backend

Python backend for an AI-assisted customer-support ticket classifier. It provides a Flask API to receive tickets, classify them with a transparent keyword-based baseline, suggest customer replies, and route uncertain cases for human review. Tickets are stored locally in SQLite, and review decisions are recorded in CSV.

The project also includes Bitext dataset download, loading, and preprocessing modules for future model training and evaluation. **The current classifier is rule-based, not a trained AI model.** This is a local development backend and is not yet configured for public deployment.

## Dataset preparation

After installing `requirements.txt`, run `python backend/prepare_data.py` once
at setup/deployment. It downloads and SHA-256-verifies the pinned Bitext CSV,
then prepares `data/processed/train.csv`, `validation.csv`, and `test.csv`.
Repeated runs verify the source and skip unchanged processed outputs. Run this
as a deployment step, **not** on each API request. `data/` stays outside Git.
